## Authentication Architecture

### Frontend Authentication Flow

```typescript
// 1. User Login Process
Firebase Auth → Get ID Token → Backend Session Creation → Local State Update

// 2. Session Management
Activity Detection → Token Refresh → Session Cookie Update → State Synchronization

// 3. Request Authentication
API Request → Check Token Validity → Auto-refresh if needed → Retry Request
```

### Key Authentication Features

- **Dual-Layer Security**: Firebase Authentication + Custom Session Cookies
- **Automatic Token Refresh**: Background refresh based on user activity
- **Session Persistence**: Zustand store with localStorage persistence
- **Request Interceptors**: Automatic retry with refreshed tokens
- **Multi-Tab Support**: Firebase Auth state synchronization
- **Secure Logout**: Proper cleanup of all auth artifacts
